    "### **Option 1: Use a Dictionary for All Courses**\n",
    "- **Description**: Maintain a lightweight dictionary containing only course department and codes, and call the API to fetch details about individual courses as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages**:\n",
    "1. **Lower Initial Loading Time**: Only the basic dictionary is loaded at startup; specific course details are fetched on demand.\n",
    "2. **Smaller Memory Usage**: Avoid storing large amounts of course data in memory unless needed.\n",
    "3. **Up-to-Date Data**: Always fetch the latest course details from the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "1. **Higher API Usage**: Frequent API calls might slow down the system and strain the API, especially with many users.\n",
    "2. **Dependency on API**: If the API becomes unavailable or slow, your website functionality might degrade.\n",
    "3. **Potential Rate Limits**: Repeated calls to the API could hit rate limits if the service enforces them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Option 2: Preload and Pickle All Course Data**\n",
    "- **Description**: At the start, fetch all course data from the API, process it into Python objects, and save it as a serialized `.pkl` file. On application startup, load this data into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages**:\n",
    "1. **Fast Access**: All course data is readily available in memory for relationships and visualizations without additional API calls.\n",
    "2. **Reduced API Dependency**: Minimizes reliance on the API once the data is preloaded and saved.\n",
    "3. **Custom Data Structures**: You can structure and preprocess data in ways that make it faster and easier to work with (e.g., adding additional fields or indexing relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "1. **Initial Loading Delay**: Fetching and processing all courses at the start can be time-consuming.\n",
    "2. **Memory Usage**: Keeping all course data in memory might use more RAM, depending on the size of the dataset.\n",
    "3. **Stale Data**: The preloaded data can become outdated if UBCâ€™s course information changes, requiring periodic refreshes."
